<h4> Web version of ModPE Book</h4>

***

<p align="center">
How does this site differ from the Android application?
<br>
<br>
<strong>The fact that it has open access to the lessons, if you do not have a phone under you or do not want to code on the phone :)</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
This site will continue to be kept in an open resource, or throw it on any web host?
<br>
<br>
<strong>At the moment: yes, there will be some time left in an open resource, but then, I will throw a web host on whatever web host, since Russian web hosts cost big money</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
Will ModPE editor be available on this site?
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>
		For a while it will not be available. Since I do not know JavaScript language, but I already have a sketch on how the editor may look. And also soon there will be some surprise for JavaScript users. Soon I need to do the BlockLauncher API, as an editor without an API is not an editor.

<p align=>Will dump memory from BlockLauncher be available for the editor?

>-Maybe not, since I will have to negotiate with the guys from the VK Group so that they can get it, or wait until Zhuowei Zhang tries to finish the modding, or wait until Mojang does a full-fledged JavaScript scripting API.

  

> Will the site be available in other languages of the world?

>

>-It is possible, but at the moment only English and Russian are available, if you want to translate into your language, write to me by Mail:<mrdubstep863@mail.ru> or to my Discord: MrDubstep863#4027

  

Who knows, maybe Mojang will be ahead of Zhuowei Zhang, just by showing the JavaScript API for the Bedrock version?
